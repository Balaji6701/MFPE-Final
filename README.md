## Deployment steps
- Every service is commited to a **AWS Code-Commit** repository.
- Every service has its own **AWS Code-Pipe** line to enable.
- After build the services will be pushed to **AWS Elastic Container Registry** as docker images.
- After the build of every service is successfull, Run the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Balaji6701/MFPE-Final/tree/main/pod1-ecs-cluster) file using following commands.
### Prerequisite
- Configure aws credential
- Install aws cli version 2
- Switch to folder where docker-compose.yml is present
```
docker context create ecs pod1-ecs
docker context use pod1-ecs
docker compose up
```
- This will create a **AWS CloudFormation Stack**, which will deploy all the services to the **AWS Elastic Container Services**.
